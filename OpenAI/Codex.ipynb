    "In addition to being trained on massive volumes of text comprising approximately 500 billion words, ChatGPT was trained with billions of lines of code. It can generate code, comment code, find bugs in code, and more, and it supports dozens of programming languages. Let's use a few examples to see what it's capable of.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, paste your OpenAI API key into the next cell in order to run the examples. If you don't already have an OpenAI account and an API key to go with it, go to https://platform.openai.com/signup and create an account. Then go to the API Keys page, generate an API key, and save it where you can easily retrieve it later. OpenAI grants you a certain amount of free usage each month, so you don't have to create a paid account in order to get an API key. Once generated, an OpenAI API key can't be retrieved by returning to the OpenAI Web site. Be sure to save it in a secure place so you can retrieve it when needed. If you lose an API key, your only recourse is to generate a new one."
