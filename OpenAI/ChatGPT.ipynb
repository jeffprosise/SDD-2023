    "\n",
    "[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) is one of several sophisticated AI models built by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), a San Francisco-based company whose mission is to \"ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.\" ChatGPT is a Large Language Model (LLM) built on GPT-3.5, which boasts 175 billion parameters and ranks as the largest neural network ever built. ChatGPT can generate human-like prose by responding to instructions written in the [Chat Markup Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/chatgpt), or ChatML for short. Here are just a few examples demonstrating how to leverage ChatGPT using its REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to paste your OpenAI API key into the next cell in order to run the examples. If you don't already have an OpenAI account and an API key to go with it, go to https://platform.openai.com/signup and create an account. Then go to the API Keys page, generate an API key, and save it where you can easily retrieve it later. OpenAI grants you a certain amount of free usage each month, so you don't have to create a paid account in order to get an API key. Once generated, an OpenAI API key can't be retrieved by returning to the OpenAI Web site. Be sure to save it in a secure place so you can retrieve it when needed. If you lose an API key, your only recourse is to generate a new one."
