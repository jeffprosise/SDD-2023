0,"california power please contact kristin walsh robert johnston for further clarification executive summary utility bankruptcy appears increasingly likely next week unless the state can clear three hurdles agreement payback for the bailout rate increases and further short term funding for dwr purchases power disagreement persists between gov davis and democrats the legislature how the state should paid back for its bailout the utilities the split over stock warrant plan versus state ownership utility transmission assets the economics the long term contracts appear show that rate hikes are unavoidable because the need amortize the undercollected rates the utilities during the recent rate freeze period air quality management district regulations are under review but offer limited scope for providing additional generation capacity legislature democrats are feeling intense pressure from the left wing consumer groups and are being forced least slow not stop davis bailout and rate hike plans senator burton eminent domain threats against generators which reflect this pressure are little significance bankruptcy outlook rising once againa deal finalize debt workout continues just beyond the reach the state the utilities and their creditors with time running out the debt forbearance arrangement set expire tuesday socal edison and are not paying any their bills except for payroll they are working very hard keep cash hand and have indicated that they feel that they are very close involuntary bankruptcy filing once this filing occurs they will have days until either the bankruptcy court accepts the filing the utilities file voluntary bankruptcy opinion within the assembly divided with respect the outlook for bankruptcy assemblyman keeley told our source that filing likely but that everything will resolved during that day period senator john burton hurry reach deal with the utilities believes that the state california good position strong arm the utilities burton currently does not intend cede the utilities that they can avoid bankruptcy the senator stated bankruptcy would bad but not the worst thing possible intends stick his position senator burton also dismissed governor davis end week deadline for striking deal with the utilities still bankruptcy can avoided last minute deal can struck monday what the state receives return for the bailoutthe scope rate hikes federal court expected rule the socal cpuc rate undercollection case monday additional financing made available the dwr buy more power until the revenue bonds can issued may there possibility that significant progress these issues could lead further extension creditor forbearance however the negative tone taken standard poors and others concerning delays the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult achieve the previous forbearance period was only achieved via high level washington summit which does not appear likely happen this weekend additional financing for dwr will not automatically approved the legislature the non energy expenditures the california government are now risk there not yet rate structure place recover the costs being expended power from the general fund state take utility debtwhile the state seems have succeeded forcing the utility parents eat close one third the billion debt final deal has been held two fronts first still unclear what the state will get return for the utility debt possible that there will mix stock warrants and transmission assets takeover the transmission assets seems more likely than takeover the hydro assets the value these assets still has not been settled second while the state will the hook for billion not clear what mixture rate hikes and revenue bonds will used recover the cost the bailout finally expect davis and other california politicians work minimize rate hikes although the edison cpuc case monday likely force their hand here and everything possible avoid the appearance bailout the tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants price has been set which the state would purchase the utilities transmission assets which are currently valued approximately billion all the proceeds though cannot used pay off the utilities debts some the money would existing bondholders however ipp sources advise that there already bid the table for these transmission assets that higher than what the state would offer long term contractsas noted the governor his announcement tuesday only the power contracted for can come line immediately much the remainder reportedly was contracted long term purchases from suppliers who are building power plants some this will come line approximately two years assemblyman keeley expressed frustration that has received tablet from high from governor davis that there must not rate increase this means that the state must acquire power not from internal sources from the market but through long term contracts cents kwh this allows cents amortize socal edison undercollection from the recent rate freeze period the number slightly different for this assumption based natural gas price and and efficiency heating rate and these numbers were quoted industry sources who felt they were unrealistic these sources quoted the price natural gas the sources agreed with keeley number for the efficiency heating rate but they felt that was very optimistic unless enormous amount new generation capacity comes line according keeley numbers and assuming the filed rate case settled billion rather than billion would take years amortize all the utility undercollection settlement this case will need reached that the state can figure out how much charge for power order amortize the undercollection however since assemblyman keeley numbers are unrealistic rate increase will necessary air quality district exemptionsthere have been few bills introduced provide exemptions from aqmd air quality management district regulations also republicans have been asking the governor lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility san jose that was denied the local government currently there contemplation loosening the aqmd compliance restrictions the legislature will not allow dirtier plants tocome line however there might change the means implementation southern california moving away from theuse credits this apparently drives the cost gas fired power democratic moderates pressured consumer advocatesthe moderate left sen burton the puc consumer activists afraid harvey rosenfield and his consumers movement this not just because his initiative more important from their perspective his initiative puts him and the far left position challenge and defeat the moderates the next election thus democrats the legislature will feel pressured distance themselves from davis and slow down any further rate increases bailout eminent domain would have limited effectthe threats burton seize generation assets insure continued power supply are limited they only apply california suppliers afederal order would needed seize assets from out state suppliers there are also canadian suppliers such hydro who are essentially untouchable smaller ipps feeling the squeezemany the smaller ipps which account for approximately production appear within

0,"california update executive summary comprehensive deal reached april chances bankruptcy increase due one day opt out clause all long term power contracts and state locked tough negotiations several issues the table puc imposed requirement forcing state times book value times book value will not use any the secured last week help their ailing utility davis announcement long term power contract didn include some details the megawatts secured this far only are available this summersome the long term contracts are really only for three monthsnone the contracts prevent california from buying peak demand the spot market one the same day davis announced long term contracts davis also quietly announce rate hike ferc may the wild card approving this deal etransmissions dealone thing that still uncertain bankruptcy may still likely alternative current negotiations buy share the electric transmission grid fail produce deal april when all long term power contracts being negotiated have one day opt out clause they can exercise unilaterally comprehensive solution has not been reached the state and its major utilities according sources close senior officials made clear that any hope for politically acceptable deal the transmission lines depends the california government willingness make major financial commitment has been completely unwilling make until now will not make final deal sell its grid unless davis agrees relieve the puc imposed requirement the electricity buyer last resort current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating purchasing enough electricity all times supply california energy needs long the state steps and makes those purchases has for the past three months the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated paying premiums for spot market power and selling consumers who are shielded low rate ceilings but officials are worried this summer supply and davis concern over how fast draining the state budget surplus things get into crunch this summer and davis makes new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity buys through long term contracts then will left holding the bag thus part the negotiations over buying the electricity grid demanding comprehensive solution that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed pay state officials are mood grant that kind get out jail free card the two sides remain locked extremely tough negotiations that are complicated three other factors state legislative demands that the price davis negotiate for and the ferc must positively approve any grid purchase the state california the principal concern the price front that wants sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value their transmission while consumer groups insist that two times book value the politically acceptable limit see times book value absolute upper bound there way will get more than that whatever they think according the leader one main consumer groups are going try force any deals down about any case negotiators for davis are also trying proposition proof any transmission deal protect against later ballot proposal they think there are ways that but not the price part the grid triggers ballot initiative remember davis eventual solution triggers ballot initiative will running for election the same ballot public initiative designed overturn his solution the sacramento front one understands motivesthe one question one sacramento can figure out what kind game playing three day period made series announcements that left everyone scratching their heads late thursday officials leaked information california papers that they had agreed principle sell their part the electricity transmission grid the state which seemed like obvious good news but then made clear discussions that the price they were asking was least above what the state was currently offering while deal can still done anything like the billion wants would very hard get through the california legislature which needs approve any purchase late friday officials announced that they had secured billion loan for the parent company not the electricity utility and would use the money pay off bondholders other creditors and return million shareholders new dividend payout not cent that money was earmarked help the struggling electricity orphan and that left least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood over the weekend leaked story claiming that was willing pay off its energy suppliers debt for cents the dollar right now for generators who are having make decisions each morning about whether start legal actions that protect their rights any eventual bankruptcy action hold off the assumption that the politics this process will make them whole couple months that kind trial balloon extremely unnerving thus very short time period corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling use these funds smooth the way toward solution the energy crisis davis has demanded that all the major utilities absorb least part the billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and fund raising will harden and deepen those demands one senior political official told our source just when you think the corporate leadership that company has insulted completely possible they come with something even more outrageous and some these long term contracts are actually only good for three months none these contracts however keep california from having buy the most expensive peak demand electricity the spot market davis agrees new consumer electricity rate hikes for next yearwhile the media was concern with davis announcement long term contracts for california less concern the media was davis quietly announced decision let rates rise again for electricity consumers the state will accept the emergency surcharge levied consumers january permanent increase well additional increase for consumers that will take effect early when the old rate cut legislation expires that would bring the average charge about cents kilowatt hour fercthe other major danger the transmission line deal that the federal energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply failing approve positive vote senior california officials and legislators doubt that ferc has jurisdiction and believe that ferc would not dare stop deal but they may wrong the deal can only through ferc specifically signs off the deal its power over transmission deal absolute matter what anyone says according source close the president there are three possibilities ferc could pocket veto not even putting agenda for discussion the deal put the agenda but gets voted down the democrat the commission william massey has already said opposed the commission could approve but with condition that davis has agree bring the lines into regional grid system one complicating factor the ferc decision however that its chairman curt hebert who adamantly opposed the transmission line sale may not around long enough have his say hebert definitely not shoo for the ferc chairman position says one washington official two other appointments the commission will soon named this official notes and one them could easily become chairman "

0,"california energy crisiscalifornia power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light want you know what the facts are and what are doing about the crisis please spend few minutes reading the following overview the situation and our position california energy issues what happened californiathe source california current problem straightforward supply and demand california economy grew percent since this increased the demand for electricity percent the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built the state demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added the result predictably shortage this summer peak capacity will about percent shy peak demand leading further blackouts the state addition the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led the current crisis first the state regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market the spot market for power extraordinarily volatile the way firms behave free market when faced with such volatility construct portfolio purchases long term medium term and short term reduce exposure this volatility california state regulation prevented this strategy this would the equivalent putting the entire state adjustable rate mortgage the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawatt was purchased the sky rocketing spot price second retail markets were not deregulated regulated retail rates remained effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured keep competition out this meant that utilities were forced pay high wholesale prices the spot market but were only able recover costs the regulated retail rate they are now nearly bankrupt short california problems were caused regulation not deregulation regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices the time california was developing its restructuring plan enron warned the state policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives which adopted would have averted the current crisis enron rolemany political leaders the state have elected fix blame rather than fix the problem power sellers including enron have been vilified the politicians and the media here are the facts other than small amount wind power enron not generator the state california every megawatt sold california bought the same market available other california purchasers because are market maker not generator are not biased toward high prices are interested only having market that works that can package products for our customers seller end use markets the state provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face protected and still protect our customers from price volatility you may have read that ees recently elected have the utilities supply power directly its customers california instead procuring power the open market early reports mischaracterized this turnback our customers the utilities here are the facts result variety factors existing the current california market made more sense for ees source power for its customers directly from the utilities this decision reduced ees market price risk allowing ees access lower utility rates ees did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue receive the financial benefits their contract prices ees continuing work with its california customers provide them with other energy related products and services including assistance reducing the demand for power particularly peak times enron currently proposing solutions help california work out its crisis enron continues sign customers the state and enron continues actively manage its risks and capture opportunities western power markets enron primary business managing risk for our customers with solutions customized meet their needs there has never been more demand for our products and services the solutionthe solution california crisis also straightforward summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance the spot market and shore the financial stability the state utilities increasing supplycalifornia process for siting and permitting new generation nothing short byzantine enron has built plants elsewhere the country less than year california often takes years california simply must streamline this process ironically while many the regulations generators must overcome are aimed improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times much nox california can have abundant power and cleaner air expediting the permitting new facilities reducing demandcustomers california today have incentive reduce shift demand they pay the same rate matter what the market price open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and demand lower prices than today california should fully open its retail market reducing reliance the spot marketin truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices purchasing some their requirements longer term fixed price basis the state has instead left procurement the hands the utilities which has forced buy exclusively the spot market opening the market the retail level will give customers control over their price risk restoring the financial integrity the state institutionsthe utilities california are not paying their bills this has led greater uncertainty the market higher costs and reduced flexibility arrive lasting solutions california must permit its utilities recover their costs they can pay their bills and invest the transmission and distribution assets necessary get power from where where needed just important doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive not fix the problem even make matters worse price caps have been proposed they don work have never worked and they will not work here price caps succeed only creating shortages which then have allocated among competing users imagine how ineffectively the government would determining for example whether better make its limited power supplies available the imperial valley silicon valley price caps are surefire way make the current shortage worse the state has also proposed take over generation and transmission california there reason believe and every reason doubt that the state will more effective than free markets investing constructing operating and maintaining assets this will also result california tax revenues being spent power transmission and power generation which the private sector can instead education roads and other public goods which the private sector cannot you are approached people outside the company are learning about the crisis from the media important for you know this enron will continue serve our customers and will continue propose real solutions the state "

catalytica got off scot free the december dash summarized the eight agreements associated with the transactions permit the following sale and repurchase the spark spread option funding xonon development amount equal the proceeds the option sale funding the turbine prepayment the pastoria project with the same option sale proceeds obtaining the right first refusal the first five commercial fas equipped with xonon and purchase the turbines off balance sheet basis enhancing the value the equity investment catalytica was mentioned strategic benefit and potential upside turbine overpricing was not mentioned the dash the risk matrix when dave added his comments the may dash understood that the million cost was intended offset million turbine credits doing allocation the cost seemed logically mean allocation the credits once they were recognised outside the slim chance that something blew the allocated cost would offset with subsequently allocated credit wash from ena perspective the issue moot the decision allocate portion the turbine overpricing the merchant portfolio but none the credits that clearly was not accounted for and certainly was not provided for the merchant asset management plan forwarded richard lydecker corp enron richard lydecker amto christopher calger pdx ect ectcc subject out interestchris thanks for the clarification pat did confirm with sheila that the turbines were overpriced which seems mean that enron ended giving gift million that seems strange also still seems that the december dash did not accurately reflect the deal unless missed did not find any reference turbine overpricing understanding dave comment the may dash was account for the acceleration period between may and september and the risk that the pastoria project would cancelled and the technology development fail that period may ena gave the opportunity stick catalytica with credits payment for the repurchase the sso rather than cash either these events occured before september and thereby lost the optionality the four months the may transaction did not change the economics the deal any other way than this acceleration the comment was intended allocate the turbine overpricing which was part the original transaction agree with you that this should have been handled that time concern has been that enron retain the benefit the credits referenced the xtia which apparently has occurred however the fact apparently that the credits had been rendered valueless from the start the turbine overpricing framework had been that long enron received the credits some form the may transaction was wash far was concerned dick christopher calger ect pmto richard lydecker corp enron enroncc subject out interestdick sounds though this caught you surprise sorry for that your chronology seems correct this thing makes head hurt every time brought believe the obligation was incurred dec but not properly recognized accounted for until the may dash delainey hand written note was the end result people dissecting the deals with the realization that the west power turbines were overpriced the and the catalytica equity account did not properly account for that dec the turbine contract refers credit but the gross turbine price was increased twice that amount that the net increase was ena agreed because piper wanted help catalytica despite much protest from dave parquet agreed with delainey and ray bowen that west power would the hook for the because the project got some benefit from catalytica delainey wanted the payment triggered sale pastoria because did not want group recognize any income until the project closed this was communicated and acknowledged accounting and reminded them every month two since mid year understand pat called sheila tweed

ect ectcc subject out interestchris couldn agree more about the confusing history the catalytica xtia and spark spread derivative transactions understanding slightly different from what you outline but you may have better sources neither were present the creation familiar with dave delainey hand written note the may dash that dash authorised accelerating repurchase the sso three months view that dave could allocate within ena his discretion did not understand the rationale however since was the december dash which established the obligation for enron fund the million all the may dash did was unwind financing arrangement three months early did not have anything with the incurrence the obligation itself the objective the complex series agreements was for enron finance development the xonon technology and return receive credits turbine purchases either pastoria for other xonon equiped turbines pastoria were cancelled original deal catalytica agreed purchase spark spread option sso from enron for million payable four instalments these instalments exactly matched the funding obligation under the xtia catalytica actually paid enron million which represented the first two instalments west made million milestone payments the enron west arrangement was off balance sheet financing deal the end the day enron was paying september enron was obligated repurchase the sso from catalytica for the amount catalytica had paid enron for turbine credits pastoria were cancelled may sso repurchase enron bought back the sso from catalytica for million the three month acceleration repurchase was supposed facilitate ipo did not impact all enron ultimate obligation which had always been for the full million catalytica was now out the chain and had further payment obligations credit entitlements december final milestone payment enron has paid million through the west financing arrangement now turbo park uncertain whether increased the price the pastoria turbines million part these transactions understanding was that there was concern about this when the turbine contract was negotiated but had thought this concern was guarded against contract negotiation with fact did increase the cost the pastoria turbines million the entire purpose and benefit enron from these incredibly complex and non intuitive documents was totally obviated net net enron would have paid develop technology application with compensatory value why enron would have done this kind deal don know not sure what internal income transfer would apply understand that has applied the million credit against progress payment billing late last year wouldn this mean that the full credit was taken pastoria unclear why the sale pastoria should trigger anything the end the day ena did the deal and how account for the consequences now irrelevant the turbines were overpriced the december dash seems misleading not disclosing that fact when approval was requested the dash actually states that

0,"california update below the transcript interview conducted yesterday with state treasurer phil angelides summary bond issuance with year term tax exempt and non exempt angelides favor wind fall profit tax opposed current discussion between davis and socal regards socal paying off the generators over years with year grace periodwhat decisions rate components are necessary before you can sell bonds the big things need are that the puc must enter into agreement with dwr essentially warranting that sufficient revenues from rates will available for purchasing power really their job define what each party needs pay for power need give assurance the investment community that whatever the overall rate the state will get enough pay its bonds however the utilities challenge the decision could stall the bond issuance what you think will the size the first bond issue based what currently possible and what the legislature has authorized around the puc has allowed sell north but anticipate that absorbable until the administration provides details for this office and the public what its costs buying power are and what needs terms funding what will drive that number not what the puc has said the issuance may well single issue series smaller ones done together each weeks apart what the total size the market for tax exempt bonds what normally bonds for various revenues general obligations the infrastructure rate reductions bonds was issuance and this was handled well this not exclusively market around these bonds sold each year anticipate that the bonds will tax exempt and non exempt what the total electric supply contracts that are firm enough require funding have estimates the dwr buying power and let say power costs and its portion rates this bond issuance covers the diff between and the bond issuance way cover the gap however power prices not come down you cannot keep borrowing issue more than bonds have see the whole financial plan the implication that will not keep this plan secret what will the term mix the bond issues overall term expected the year range not know the mix you have the ability bridging tax anticipation notes anything like that take care the general fund the very purpose the bridge loan that are taking taxable and tax exempt bridge loan until bonds are issued order for issue bonds number steps have occur would hope that the puc and dwr what they have realistically june then the bond issuance would come semi all once other words either all once something like billion every three weeks are all the general funds assets cash are some the form less liquid receivable have lot liquidity real cash general fund have cash flow have the ability pooled money investment accounts that can out five years have plus that account what the minimum working capital required the general fund for day day operations depends and goes and down any given day are doing the order there budget between the general funds and special fund are you discussing the dwr contracting relation the required funding you have veto the deals struck this all the administration court what have asked for the information have asked for this today letter have move from working with banks public offering which means public disclosure the general fund has been making advances buy power but want get out that business and stop the plus drain general fund from arranging interim loan what the credit risk from industry other large users cherry picking self selecting there are limits the options out there ablx has limited the ability people opt out the system you allow them opt out what they have pay preserve the revenue stream the agreement between the dwr and the puc will say that through financing order will get you the revenue service the bonds even adjusts rates this will covenant that the money will made available initiative launched could create enough uncertainty have effect abix the bond issuance what about harvey proofing what the direct state participation the state role infrastructure and economic development bonds will issued name dwr only pay for power the state buying not repay utility deb don think the state will repay utility debt the state can buy power out chapter there will participation the state bank know harvey well and and agree number things for example cosponsoring the public power authority should not put the state the business refinancing utility debt don think most consumer groups realize that are selling bonds pay for power very much want and interest repay the general fund the same time that this office financing the purchase energy the fundamental problem the price are being charged the generators the ransom that being demanded the generators agree with harvey that this current time the generators are winning will have consider excess profits taxes the generators continue they have increased their prices tenfold the generators they bought set plants for since january the state has spent over the generators don take their foot off our throat they may leave option but take back plants under emergency power let them justify those rates what causes the problem the generators jacking prices the point where they will make something about what the measurable size premium that will have paid based the most current estimates bond issue size measurable the wrong choice words don know how many basis points more than will begin feel also not for that proposal allow the utilities pay off the generators over years with year grace period they should work that out themselves not the backs ratepayers the perspective here that they did very very well and they upstreamed billions "

anything quite this electrifying since the when local teenager annie mae bullock left town and became tina turner the queen rock roll power plants are sprouting the flat rich cotton fields nearby one under construction another about start bulldozers are grooming site for third think great says alvin williams owner the nutbush grocery and deli prepares for the surge construction workers who come for lunch while this may seem promising time growing energy shortages the new plants are part power clash that presents the bush administration and federal and state regulators with one their knottiest problems who controls the nation power grid one side new breed freewheeling energy dealers called merchant traders spurred deregulation generate and trade electricity led here enron corp they build small gas fired generating plants but most don construct their own power lines instead they hook the plants existing lines and sell electricity wholesale over long distances when prices peak during the summer thus many their plants are called peakers the other side are old line utilities represented here the federally owned tennessee valley authority they operate the power lines and warn that the system could become overloaded leading blackouts from the imbalance near nutbush here tennessee southwest corner natural gas pipelines run from the gulf coast and intersect with some the tva miles transmission lines which are spread over seven southern states that what making nutbush boom attractive place connect the grid least new merchant plants altogether will hooked across the tva system there will dozens more neighboring systems that will also use tva lines says terry boston tva executive vice president this year tva expects requests for wholesale power deals its system from last year and just boston foresees congestion problem that will make more difficult for the utility maintain its record reliability this summer going interesting says combat started here the spring when enron plant nearby brownsville began bombarding tva with about requests for summer transmission service from the tva had received from merchant plants the year before some were huge elaborate trades involving brokered electricity from other sources that enron wanted ship across the tva system kevin presto enron vice president recalled the tva pretty much fought the whole way even though they needed the megawatts that june tva pulled the plug telling enron that from then its wheeling and dealing would confined the amount electricity produced enron plants enron claimed foul and appealed the north american electric reliability council nerc voluntary organization utilities and electricity consumers along with the federal energy regulatory commission and state regulators nerc functions the traffic cop for north america power grid enron also sued the tva and the dispute raised number issues that are trying put our fingers says don benjamin nerc director operations one upshot that busy rewriting the rules for how the national grid controlled the bush administration energy task force and congress are also looking the control issue and ways expand the grid capacity far they have found easy inexpensive answers the grid with its dense webs surrounding major cities and few links between resembles highway map from the before the interstate system was built and governed rules that were negotiated utilities about that time they began interconnect their systems with their neighbors big utilities became control areas that perform the moment moment adjustments that keep lines from overloading and equipment from melting down with electricity supply must always match demand but lately operators merchant plants such enron have also qualified become control areas regulators have ordered utilities give merchant power plants open access the grid though the utilities sometimes curtail access for reliability reasons this was very good system sighs thomas overbye engineering professor the university illinois but while merchant plants have more access the grid notes they have little incentive build more power lines when you restructure that way asserts overbye you going overload the system and that exactly what happening nerc benjamin worries that control will get harder this summer got able look this and see what effects these deals are having the whole system says some hoc curtailment wholesale deals and service customers may necessary protect the grid but the result will expensive notes means that merchants won make money that deal and that the customer they sold power will have buy from somebody else the summer there were such curtailments last summer there were lynn church president the electric power supply association which represents merchant power companies and electricity traders suspects that decisions taken big utilities for reliability reasons are sometimes used block legitimate competition from her members prevent this her group wants more federal control over the grid seeing lots discrimination the tva boston counters that his system can take more surprises such the one aug when series wholesale trades brought the tva part the grid the brink collapse from the overload this year enron settled its fight with the tva with secret out court settlement enron says also the process selling the plant near here and two others had hooked the tva system other merchant power producers but still waging war over who controls the grid separate case now before the supreme court enron argues that ferc has the power open more the grid capacity merchant power plants utility commissioners from several states argue doesn while this going ferc pondering how cut back the grid proliferating number control areas right now there are about according one ferc expert who asked not identified avoid complications there should around meanwhile officials tina turner home turf still want the power plant construction keep

home internet and mail access for the first time ever not just ordinary population either but one that populated with wealth education and the desire travel that what systcom isyj executives figured few years back when they pioneered exclusive technology deliver internet and mail access cruise ships using the ships existing wiring thats not all they also pioneered the installation cabin amenities video demand vod satellite video gaming interactive services travel and entertainment booking plus more now after three very successful pilot installations detailed later this alert and fourth just completed systcom now shipping its sealynx system setting course for full scale roll out the scope this business opportunity staggering the profit potential even more its why this undiscovered stock could soar near termgrowing investment ormore months less for investors seeking aggressive play low cost high potential stock this one could screaming bargain right now hovering just the pink sheets isyj has been holding well against the downside offering stable entry point pending big news and breakout announcements and that could come any day now systcom has already deployed their sealynx technology ships the prestigious silverseas cruise line and only days ago announced their second deployment the oceania cruise line press release businesswire thats vessels already and more news likely released the coming weeks all this sets the stage for move onto otcbbwhich precisely where company chairman and ceo will riner ready take isyj from there the breakout could unfold skyrocketing pace share price july invest isyj now youll around share just preceding the time when next yearsinvestors could clamoring for shares more the independent investment advisor the research works projected isyj trade july from their report management has suggested that the silversea contract the company model for the future systcom negotiates with other cruise lines representing ships and cabins the company expects gross approximately weekly per cabin revenue expands expanding those revenue figures yields stunning numbers north america alone cruise ship cabins berths represents total potential market for isyj million year systcoms very reasonable growth strategy which has been updated ships over months projects revenues million year and the current netprofitability around gross

could make your dreams come true and the best part the technology already installed and serving thousands passengers right now its just waiting grow more and more ships are outfitted with the systcom sealynx system the current installation schedule isyj profits could coming fast according projections provided ceo wil riner systcom could reach first profitability early quarter companies the pink sheets fantasize about the day when they may see revenues let alone those that turn profit yet systcom projecting profits just few months from now whats more the current installations are working planned and revenues are beginning flow that make profits very real probability thus this one those pivotal moments companys life that marks turning point for investors you invest nowor you wait and miss the explosive price surge coming out pink sheet valuations youre aggressive investor the answer should clear todays share price this could one thevery best investment decisions you make even you limited yourself just few thousand shares you could turn handsome profit just few months with very modest downside risk whats more buying now youll setting the stage for major breakout the future and fat profit pad your position not pipe dream not promise its real onboard and happening now since the systcom already operational number ships serving tens thousands passengers you dont have wait for the sales department prove that theres market either new orders should coming very quickly especially cruise lines see the capabilities their competitors grow rather than looking for customers systcom could faced with the enviable problem having them line the door competition not any time soon this fantasy island profit opportunity youll love this part the show right now theres competition the systcom technology its the only show town cruise line wants internet connections the cabins has two choices dry dock and retrofit choose systcom interface with their existing systems the growing market and only one source for sensible solution according more cruise industry statistics about million passengers cruise ship passengers boarded north american cruise ships you know what that means whole city full americans with personal access the internet even for mail these are people who write big checks for first class service its reasonable think that the vast majority them live mail home and work and since most cruises last more than week internet access could make break point about booking cruise whats more the problem getting worse since the year the cruise industry has grown from million passengers million the figures are expected soar past million passengers and youre going deny these people access the internet since most cruise ships were built years ago with wiring that did not anticipate modern internet the cruise operators have had nothing offer except board public internet lounges that just doesnt cut the systcom solution puts the internet into every cabin board live sports shows and movies too from marketing perspective this could the right product the right time for growing industry once cruise company makes the commitment upgrade cabininternet mail and interactive services systcom can have fully operational system and running matter weeks with downtime and disruption normal cruise activities systcoms technology breakthrough came when developed interface that linked the existing phone wiring with the ships band band com links these com links provide the uplink and downlink needed enable internet and satellite access while the systcom sealynx system manages the bandwidth possible the room room wiring network reported systcom management nobody else has this technology nor anything like whats more systcom not just targeting the cruise ship industry the resorts cruise ship destinations face the same dilemmas high end resorts remote islands face similar challenges providing guests with access online entertainment movies and sports programming that their american guests have come expect using systcom technology resorts could soon offer complete menu room entertainment including internet access and mail that market adds millions more travelers systcoms potential revenue equation invest now isyj and you could sit back and relax profit making cruise lifetime and you can expect your investment will well managed because even though systcom relatively new company systcom commanded seasoned crew technology and cruise industry veterans with veterans like this the helm you can certain your investment will stay true
